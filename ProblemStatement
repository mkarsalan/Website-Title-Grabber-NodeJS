Problem Statement

Create a node server which responds to one and only one route : GET /I/want/title

This route expects a list of websites addresses in query string format e.g.

/I/want/title/?address=google.com
/I/want/title/?address=http://yahoo.com
/I/want/title/?address=google.com&address=www.dawn.com/events/
etc.

The number of addresses can be more than one.

The route will make request to each of the address passed to it. It will parse out the <title></title> tags, render them in html and send back the html in response. e.g. the response to above #3 example would be:
 
<html>
<head></head>
<body>

    <h1> Following are the titles of given websites: </h1>

    <ul>
       <li> google.com - "Google" </li>
       <li> www.dawn.com/events/ - "Events - DAWN.COM" </li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
For all other routes, the server should return HTTP code 404 .

Please make sure to add error handling e.g.

/I/want/title/?address=asdasdasd should return <li> asdasdasd - NO RESPONSE </li>

Tasks

Implement the above task using plain node.js callbacks (you can use express or http or any other helper module but nothing which absracts control flow).
Implement the above using some kind of flow library e.g. async.js or step.js
Implement the above using Promises. You could use any library e.g. RSVP or Q
BONUS: Implement the above using Streams e.g. bacon.js or RxJs
